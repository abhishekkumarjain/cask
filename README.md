sparse-bench
============

Benchmarking linear algebra libraries on CPU, GPU and FPGA.


Prerequisites
=============

TODO: add links, more specific instructions

You should have installed:

1. For CPU benchmarking:
  - armadillo and its dependencies -- this doesn't seem to have CG solver
  - PetSC
  - trilinos?
  
2. For GPU benchmarking:
  - CUDA and its dependecies, including cuSparse, cusp

3. For FPGA benchmarking:
  - coming soon...

4. Other:
  - python2.7 (including the wget package)
